# SeriesManager [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/almynic/SeriesManager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/almynic/SeriesManager)

An app that cleans up serie episodes and films in a given folder. GUI application is planned in the future.

I began writing this app because I was fed up with the directory unorder of series episodes and films so I wrote this app that automates the cleanup of the directories
and creates folders for the serie episode and films if they don't exist yet and then move films and series to the right folder.
